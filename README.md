In this application, you can keep track of various train schedules and times with adding in the fields provided.

Once you enter the Train Name, Destination, First Train Time, Frequency, and press the submit button, you train time should be displayed in the table above.

This data is stored in a database so if you were to reload the page your train times will not be lost.

This app also generates the next train available and the minutes until arrival, based on the information you provided in the form at the bottom of the page.

Enjoy this one, its really cool!
